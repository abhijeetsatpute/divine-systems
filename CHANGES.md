## Updates Applied

### 1. Fixed Scroll Offset for Navigation ✅
- **Perfect alignment**: Sections now scroll to the exact top position
- **Special Home handling**: Home section scrolls to absolute top (0px)
- **Removed offset**: Changed from 120px offset to 0px for other sections
- **Applies to**: All navbar links and CTA button in hero section
- **Result**: Clean, precise scrolling to each section

#### What Was Fixed
**Problem 1**: When clicking nav links, sections were scrolling too low (120px offset)
**Problem 2**: Home section was only showing half the hero section
**Solution**:
- Removed the 120px header offset for all sections
- Added special case for Home to scroll to absolute top (0px)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` (lines 48-73):
  - Added special case for #home → scrolls to position 0
  - Removed 120px offset for other sections
- `src/components/Hero.jsx` (line 23-25): Removed 120px offset from CTA button

### 2. Active Navigation Link Highlighting ✅
- **Enhanced section detection**: Now accurately detects which section is most visible in viewport
- **Visual feedback**: Active section name is highlighted in teal color (`--accent`)
- **Underline indicator**: Active link has a thicker (3px) teal underline
- **Smooth transitions**: Color and underline animate smoothly when switching sections
- **Works on scroll**: Automatically updates as you scroll through sections
- **Works on click**: Updates immediately when clicking nav links

#### Technical Implementation
**Location**: `src/components/Navbar.jsx` (lines 8-46)

The new algorithm:
1. Calculates how much of each section is visible in the viewport
2. Determines which section has the maximum visibility
3. Marks that section as active
4. Updates on every scroll event
5. Also runs on initial page load

**Visual Styles**: `src/style.css` (lines 120-129)
```css
.nav-links a.active {
  color: var(--accent);          /* Teal color */
  font-weight: 700;
}

.nav-links a.active::after {
  width: 100%;                   /* Full-width underline */
  background: var(--accent);     /* Teal underline */
  height: 3px;                   /* Thicker than normal */
}
```

### 3. Dark Mode as Default ✅
- Changed default theme from `light` to `dark`
- Location: `src/hooks/useTheme.js:5`
- Users can still toggle to light mode
- Preference is saved in localStorage

### 4. Full-Screen Sections ✅
- All sections now take up full viewport height
- Added `min-height: 100vh` to all `.section` elements
- Sections are centered vertically with flexbox
- Responsive padding adjusted for mobile devices

### CSS Changes

#### Desktop (src/style.css:241-254)
```css
.section {
  min-height: 100vh;          /* Full viewport height */
  display: flex;              /* Flexbox for centering */
  align-items: center;        /* Vertical centering */
  justify-content: center;    /* Horizontal centering */
  padding: 8rem 0;           /* Comfortable spacing */
  /* ... other styles ... */
}
```

#### Tablet (max-width: 768px)
```css
.section {
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding: 6rem 0;
}
```

#### Mobile (max-width: 480px)
```css
.section {
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding: 5rem 0;
}
```

## Visual Impact

### Before
- Sections had fixed padding (12rem top, 10rem bottom)
- Content could be smaller than viewport
- Scroll felt cramped on some sections

### After
- Each section fills the entire screen
- Content is vertically centered
- Better visual hierarchy and breathing room
- Smooth full-screen scroll experience
